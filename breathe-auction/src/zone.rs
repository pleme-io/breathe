//! `zone` — the breathable autonomous zone (theory/BREATHABILITY.md §II.6.8).
//!
//! **The correction that shaped this module (stated so the history isn't
//! lost).** The theory doc's first draft proposed a brand-new "O6" invariant
//! for cross-surface structural dependency. A direct source read of
//! `breathe-catalog` found that invariant already exists, shipped, and
//! tested: [`breathe_catalog::DimensionSpec::depends_on`] is a typed `&[DimensionId]`
//! edge list per dimension, checked acyclic
//! ([`breathe_catalog::dependency_graph_is_acyclic`]) and dangling-edge-free by the
//! catalog's own reflection tests. Its ONLY consumer today is
//! `breathe-facade`, which renders it into a JSON `dependsOn` status field —
//! informational, never used to order a tick's decisions. This module is the
//! missing consumer: it turns that already-proven-acyclic graph into an
//! executable [`shigoto_dag::Dag`].
//!
//! **The one genuinely new piece.** `depends_on` is scoped to `DimensionId`
//! (k8s/host resource bands — memory, cpu, storage, …); `breathe_catalog::forma`'s
//! own `falls_back_to` graph is scoped to `Forma` (infra shapes — node pools,
//! IOPS, …) and means something different (substitution on failure, not
//! ordering on success). Neither catalog crosses into the other, but the
//! camelot 17-pod incident's root cause is EXACTLY a cross-catalog edge (a
//! `Forma` decision — which node-pool shape to run — gates a `DimensionId`
//! decision — what pod-density a `Cpu`/`Memory` band may assume). [`BreatheZone`]
//! is that typed bridge: a zone names which `Forma`s and `DimensionId`s
//! compose it, plus which dims a `Forma` resolution structurally gates.
